# Project Overview

This project is part of Udacity FEND program.
The site shows a feed reader that grab rss feeds from different sites to display them
The site also have a menu that is hidden by default, and can be opened by clicking a menu button.

##Jasmine Testing
Jasmine is included in the project to run tests on the feed reader app.
You can view the test results at the bottom of the page.
I have written comments in feedreader.js to describe the test conditions and how to make the tests fail in order to confirm that they are working correctly.

##Running the app
To run the app, copy the repository to your computer, and open index.html in a browser.
You will see a series of tests run through Jasmine on the site to check the functionality of the application.
